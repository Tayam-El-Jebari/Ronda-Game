To create a Ronda card game using the https://deckofcardsapi.com/, you need to follow these steps:

Create a new deck of cards without jokers.
Request:

sql
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/?jokers_enabled=false
Remove the 8s and 9s from the deck.
To do this, you need to make two requests to the API: one to draw the 8s and another one to draw the 9s.

Request to draw the 8s:

ruby
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=4&cards=8D,8H,8S,8C
Request to draw the 9s:

ruby
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=4&cards=9D,9H,9S,9C
Replace <<deck_id>> with the deck_id you got from step 1.

Shuffle the deck.
Request:

ruby
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/shuffle/


Deal the cards to the players.
Request to deal 3 cards to each player:

ruby
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=3
Repeat this request for each player (2 or 4 players).

Deal 4 cards to the center of the table.
Request:

ruby
Copy code
GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=4
You will need to implement the game logic to ensure the cards in the center are of different ranks and not in sequence. If necessary, replace cards by drawing new ones and reshuffling the invalid cards back into the deck.

Proceed with the game logic, capturing cards, and scoring according to the Ronda rules explained in your description.

When dealing the second batch of 3 cards, use the same request as in step 4.

You will need to implement the game logic, card capturing, and scoring mechanisms in your application using your preferred programming language. The Deck of Cards API will help you manage the deck, shuffling, and drawing cards, but the game logic must be implemented on your end.



To create a Ronda card game using VueJS and the https://deckofcardsapi.com/, follow these steps:

Set up a new VueJS project:

sql
Copy code
vue create ronda-game
cd ronda-game
npm install axios
vue add router
npm run serve
Create a new folder named components under the src folder and add the following components:

Card.vue
Player.vue
GameTable.vue
Edit src/router/index.js to add a route for the game:

javascript
Copy code
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import GameTable from '@/components/GameTable.vue';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'GameTable',
    component: GameTable,
  },
];

const router = new VueRouter({
  mode: 'history',
  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
  routes,
});

export default router;
In Card.vue, define the card component:

html
Copy code
<template>
  <div class="card">
    <img :src="card.image" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    card: Object,
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.card {
  width: 80px;
  height: 120px;
}
</style>
In Player.vue, define the player component:

html
Copy code
<template>
  <div class="player">
    <div class="player-name">{{ player.name }}</div>
    <div class="player-cards">
      <Card v-for="(card, index) in player.cards" :key="index" :card="card" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Card from './Card.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    Card,
  },
  props: {
    player: Object,
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.player {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.player-name {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.player-cards {
  display: flex;
}
</style>
In GameTable.vue, define the game table component and implement the game logic:

html
Copy code
<template>
  <div class="game-table">
    <Player v-for="(player, index) in players" :key="index" :player="player" />
    <div class="center-cards">
      <Card v-for="(card, index) in centerCards" :key="index" :card="card" />
    </div>
    <button @click="startGame">Start Game</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';
import Card from './Card.vue';
import Player from './Player.vue';

const DECK_API = 'https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck';

export default {
  components: {
    Card,
    Player,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      deckId: '',
      players: [],
      centerCards: [],
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async startGame() {
      await this.createDeck();
      await this.removeEightsAndNines();
      await this.shuffleDeck();
      await this.dealCards();
      await this.dealCenterCards();
     
Create a VueJS project where you can play the card game ronda. Use the deckofcardsapi like this: "To create a Ronda card game using the https://deckofcardsapi.com/, you need to follow these steps:

Request to draw the 9s:

ruby
Copy code

Replace <<deck_id>> with the deck_id you got from step 1.

Shuffle the deck.

Deal the cards to the players.
Request to deal 3 cards to each player:

Repeat this request for each player (2 or 4 players).

Deal 4 cards to the center of the table.
